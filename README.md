# Prithvi-EO-Segmentation

This repo is forked from the ['Prithvi-EO-Segmentation'](https://github.com/easare377/Prithvi-EO-Segmentation) code repository originally assembled by [Emmanuel Asare](https://github.com/easare377) of the University of Floria. His repo was developed leveraging the Prithvi Earth Observation (EO) foundational model, specifically for land cover classification in this case. In this case, Prithvi EO was fine-tuned for the detection of artisanal mining activity using Sentinel-2 imagery.
