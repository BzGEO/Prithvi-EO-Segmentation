# Prithvi-EO-Segmentation

This repo is forked from the ['Prithvi-EO-Segmentation'](https://github.com/easare377/Prithvi-EO-Segmentation) code repository originally assembled by [Emmanuel Asare](https://github.com/easare377) of the University of Floria. His repo was developed leveraging the Prithvi Earth Observation (EO) foundational model, specifically for **land cover classification** in this case. In this case, Prithvi EO was fine-tuned for the detection of **artisanal mining activity** using **Sentinel-2** imagery.

This repository's code is run in four steps:

1. [Sentinel-2 data pre-processing](https://github.com/BzGEO/Prithvi-EO-Segmentation/blob/main/01_Pre_process_data__v2025-08-06_eac.ipynb)
2. [Prepration of training data](https://github.com/BzGEO/Prithvi-EO-Segmentation/blob/main/02_Training_%26_Segmentation__v2025-08-06_eac.ipynb)
3. [Model evaluation](https://github.com/BzGEO/Prithvi-EO-Segmentation/blob/main/03_Model_Evaluation__v2025-08-06_eac.ipynb)
4. [Land cover mapping](https://github.com/BzGEO/Prithvi-EO-Segmentation/blob/main/04_Generate_LC_map_Prithvi__v2025-08-06_eac.ipynb)
